Plugins provide Knip with entry files and dependencies it would be unable to
find otherwise. Plugins always do at least one of the following:

1. Define entry file patterns
2. Find dependencies in configuration files

Knip v5.1.0 introduced a new plugin API, which makes them a breeze to write and
maintain.

:::tip[The new plugin API]

Easy things should be easy, and complex things possible.

:::

This tutorial walks through example plugins so you'll be ready to write your
own! The following examples demonstrate the elements a plugin can implement.

There's a handy command available to easily [create a new plugin][1] and get
started right away.

## Example 1: entry

Let's dive right in. Here's the entire source code of the Tailwind plugin:

```ts
import type { IsPluginEnabled, Plugin } from '../../types/config.js';
import { hasDependency } from '../../util/plugin.js';

const title = 'Tailwind';

const enablers = ['tailwindcss'];

const isEnabled: IsPluginEnabled = ({ dependencies }) =>
  hasDependency(dependencies, enablers);

const entry = ['tailwind.config.{js,cjs,mjs,ts}'];

export default {
  title,
  enablers,
  isEnabled,
  entry,
} satisfies Plugin;
```

Yes, that's the entire plugin! Let's go over each item one by one:

### 1. `title`

The title of the plugin displayed in the [list of plugins][2] and in debug
output.

### 2. `enablers`

An array of strings to match one or more dependencies in `package.json` so the
`isEnabled` function can determine whether the plugin should be enabled or not.
Regular expressions are allowed as well.

### 3. `isEnabled`

This function checks whether a match is found in the `dependencies` or
`devDependencies` in `package.json`. The plugin is be enabled if the dependency
is listed in `package.json`.

This function can be kept straightforward with the `hasDependency` helper.

### 4. `entry`

This plugin exports `entry` file patterns. This means that if the Tailwind
plugin is enabled, then `tailwind.config.*` files are added as entry files. A
Tailwind configuration file does not contain anything particular, so adding it
as an `entry` to treat it as a regular source file is enough.

The next example shows how to handle a tool that has its own particular
configuration object.

## Example 2: config

Here's the full source code of the `nyc` plugin:

```ts
import { toDeferResolve } from '../../util/input.js';
import { hasDependency } from '../../util/plugin.js';
import type { NycConfig } from './types.js';
import type {
  IsPluginEnabled,
  Plugin,
  ResolveConfig,
} from '../../types/config.js';

const title = 'nyc';

const enablers = ['nyc'];

const isEnabled: IsPluginEnabled = ({ dependencies }) =>
  hasDependency(dependencies, enablers);

const config = [
  '.nycrc',
  '.nycrc.{json,yml,yaml}',
  'nyc.config.js',
  'package.json',
];

const resolveConfig: ResolveConfig<NycConfig> = config => {
  const extend = config?.extends ?? [];
  const requires = config?.require ?? [];
  return [extend, requires].flat().map(id => toDeferResolve(id));
};

export default {
  title,
  enablers,
  isEnabled,
  config,
  resolveConfig,
} satisfies Plugin;
```

Here's an example `config` file that will be handled by this plugin:

```json title=".nycrc.json"
{
  "extends": "@istanbuljs/nyc-config-typescript",
  "check-coverage": true
}
```

Compared to the first example, this plugin has two new variables:

### 5. `config`

The `config` array contains all possible locations of the config file for the
tool. Knip loads matching files and passes the results (i.e. its default export)
into the `resolveConfig` function:

### 6. `resolveConfig`

This function receives the exported value of the `config` file, and executes the
`resolveConfig` function with this object. The plugin should return the entry
paths and dependencies referenced in this object.

Knip supports JSON, YAML, TOML, JavaScript and TypeScript config files. Files
without an extension are provided as plain text strings.

:::tip[Should I implement resolveConfig?]

You should implement `resolveConfig` if any of these are true:

- The `config` file contains one or more options that represent [entry
  points][3]
- The `config` file references dependencies by strings (not import statements)

:::

## Example 3: entry paths

### 7. entry and production

Some tools operate mostly on entry files, some examples:

- Mocha looks for test files at `test/*.{js,cjs,mjs}`
- Storybook looks for stories at `*.stories.@(mdx|js|jsx|tsx)`

And some of those tools allow to configure those locations and patterns in
configuration files, such as `next.config.js` or `vite.config.ts`. If that's the
case we can define `resolveConfig` in our plugin to take this from the
configuration object and return it to Knip:

Here's an example from the Mocha plugin:

```ts
const entry = ['**/test/*.{js,cjs,mjs}'];

const resolveConfig: ResolveConfig<MochaConfig> = localConfig => {
  const entryPatterns = localConfig.spec ? [localConfig.spec].flat() : entry;
  return entryPatterns.map(id => toEntry(id));
};

export default {
  entry,
  resolveConfig,
};
```

With Mocha, you can configure `spec` file patterns. The result of implementing
`resolveConfig` is that users don't need to duplicate this configuration in both
the tool (e.g. Mocha) and Knip.

Use `production` entries to target source files that represent production code.

:::tip

Regardless of the presence of `resolveConfig`, add `entry` and `production` to
the default export so they will be displayed in the plugin's documentation as
default values.

:::

## Example 4: Use the AST directly

If the `resolveFromConfig` function is implemented, Knip loads the configuration
file and passes the default-exported object to this plugin function. However,
that object might then not contain the information we need.

Here's an example `astro.config.ts` configuration file with a Starlight
integration:

```ts
import starlight from '@astrojs/starlight';
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';

export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [
    starlight({
      components: {
        Head: './src/components/Head.astro',
        Footer: './src/components/Footer.astro',
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

With Starlight, components can be defined to override the default internal ones.
They're not otherwise referenced in your source code, so you'd have to manually
add them as entry files ([Knip itself did this][4]).

In the Astro plugin, there's no way to access this object containing
`components` to add the component files as entry files if we were to try:

```ts
const resolveConfig: ResolveConfig<AstroConfig> = async config => {
  console.log(config); //  Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
};
```

This is why plugins can implement the `resolveFromAST` function.

### 7. resolveFromAST

Let's take a look at the Astro plugin implementation. This example assumes some
familiarity with Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) and the TypeScript compiler API.
Knip will provide more and more AST helpers to make implementing plugins more
fun and a little less tedious.

Anyway, let's dive in. Here's how we're adding the Starlight `components` paths
to the default `production` file patterns:

```ts
import ts from 'typescript';
import {
  getDefaultImportName,
  getImportMap,
  getPropertyValues,
} from '../../typescript/ast-helpers.js';

const title = 'Astro';

const production = [
  'src/pages/**/*.{astro,mdx,js,ts}',
  'src/content/**/*.mdx',
  'src/middleware.{js,ts}',
  'src/actions/index.{js,ts}',
];

const getComponentPathsFromSourceFile = (sourceFile: ts.SourceFile) => {
  const componentPaths: Set<string> = new Set();
  const importMap = getImportMap(sourceFile);
  const importName = getDefaultImportName(importMap, '@astrojs/starlight');

  function visit(node: ts.Node) {
    if (
      ts.isCallExpression(node) &&
      ts.isIdentifier(node.expression) &&
      node.expression.text === importName // match the starlight() function call
    ) {
      const starlightConfig = node.arguments[0];
      if (ts.isObjectLiteralExpression(starlightConfig)) {
        const values = getPropertyValues(starlightConfig, 'components');
        for (const value of values) componentPaths.add(value);
      }
    }

    ts.forEachChild(node, visit);
  }

  visit(sourceFile);

  return componentPaths;
};

const resolveFromAST: ResolveFromAST = (sourceFile: ts.SourceFile) => {
  // Include './src/components/Head.astro' and './src/components/Footer.astro'
  // as production entry files so they're also part of the analysis
  const componentPaths = getComponentPathsFromSourceFile(sourceFile);
  return [...production, ...componentPaths].map(id => toProductionEntry(id));
};

export default {
  title,
  production,
  resolveFromAST,
} satisfies Plugin;
```

## Inputs

You may have noticed functions like `toDeferResolve` and `toEntry`. They're a
way for plugins to tell what they've found and how Knip should handle those. The
more precision a plugin can provide here, the better results and performance
will be.

Find all the details over at [Writing A Plugin â†’ Inputs][5].

## Argument Parsing

As part of the [script parser][6], Knip parses command-line arguments. Plugins
can implement the `arg` object to add custom argument parsing tailored to the
tool.

Read more in [Writing A Plugin â†’ Argument Parsing][7].

## Create a new plugin

The easiest way to create a new plugin is to use the `create-plugin` script:

```sh
cd packages/knip
bun create-plugin --name tool
```

This adds source and test files and fixtures to get you started. It also adds
the plugin to the JSON Schema and TypeScript types.

Run the test for your new plugin:

```sh
bun test test/plugins/tool.test.ts
```

You're ready to implement and submit a new Knip plugin! ðŸ†• ðŸŽ‰

## Wrapping Up

Feel free to check out the implementation of other similar plugins, and borrow
ideas and code from those!

The documentation website takes care of generating the [plugin list and the
individual plugin pages][2] from the exported plugin values.
