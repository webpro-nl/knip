Today brings the smallest major release so far. Tiny yet mighty!

Below are two cases to demonstrate the change in how unused exports are
reported.

## Case 1

The first case shows two exports with a namespaced import that references one of
those exports explicitly:

```ts title="knip.js"
export const version = 'v5';
export const getRocket = () => 'üöÄ';
```

```ts title="index.js"
import * as NS from './knip.js';

console.log(NS.version);
```

In this case we see that `getRocket` is an unused export.

Previously it would go into the "Unused exports in namespaces" category
(`nsExports`). This issue has been moved to the "Unused exports" category
(`exports`).

## Case 2

The second case is similar, but only the imported namespace itself is
referenced. None of the individual exports is referenced:

```ts title="index.js"
import * as NS from './knip.js';
import send from 'stats';

send(NS);
```

Are the `version` and `getRocket` exports used? We can't know. The same is true
for the spread object pattern:

```ts title="index.js"
import * as NS from './knip.js';

const Spread = { ...NS };
```

Previously those exports would go into the "Unused exports in namespaces"
category. This is still the case, but this category is no longer enabled by
default.

## Include unused exports in namespaces

To enable this type of issues in Knip v5, add this argument to the command:

```shell
knip --include nsExports
```

Or in your configuration file:

```json title="knip.json"
{
  "include": ["nsExports", "nsTypes"]
}
```

Now `version` and `getRocket` will be reported as "Unused exports in
namespaces".

Note that `nsExports` and `nsTypes` are split for more granular control.

## Handling exports in namespaced imports

You have a few options to handle namespaced imports when it comes to unused
exports.

### 1. Use named imports

Regardless of whether `nsExports` is enabled or not, it's often good practice to
replace the namespaced imports with named imports:

```ts title="index.js"
import { version, getRocket } from './knip.js';

send({ version, getRocket });
```

Whenever possible, explicit over implicit is often the better choice.

### 2. Standardized JSDoc tags

Using one of the available JSDoc tags like `@public` or `@internal`:

```ts title="knip.js"
export const version = 'v5';
/** @public */
export const getRocket = () => 'üöÄ';
```

Assuming only imported using a namespace (like in the example cases above), this
will exclude the `getRocket` export from the report, even though it isn't
explicitly referenced.

### 3. Arbitrary JSDoc tags

Another solution is to tag individual exports arbitrarily:

```ts title="knip.js"
export const version = 'v5';
/** @launch */
export const getRocket = () => 'üöÄ';
```

And then exclude the tag like so:

```shell
$ knip --experimental-tags=-launch
Exports in used namespace (1)
version  NS  unknown  knip.js:1:1
```

Assuming only imported using a namespace (like in the example cases above), this
will exclude the `getRocket` export from the report, even though it isn't
explicitly referenced.

## A better default

I believe this behavior in v5 is the better default: have all exports you want
to know about in a single category, and those you probably want to ignore in
another that's disabled by default.

Before the [v4 refactoring][1], this would be a lot harder to implement. That
refactoring turns out to be a better investment than expected. Combined with a
better understanding of how people write code and use Knip, this change is a
natural iteration.

Why the major bump? It's not breaking for the large majority of users, but for
some it may be breaking. For instance when relying on the [JSON reporter][2],
other reporter output, or custom [preprocessing][3]. It's not a bug fix, it's
not a new feature, but since semver is all about setting expectations I feel the
change is large enough to warrant a major bump.
