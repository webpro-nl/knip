Lots of new users got introduced to Knip, coming with clear bug reports, helpful
insights, superb reproductions and great suggestions this year. You're all a
friendly and helpful bunch! Recently I've opened a Discord channel where more
communication, collaboration, ideas and updates are happening: feel free to join
[The Knip Barn][1]!

Today, Knip has [over 140k weekly downloads on npm][2], [almost 4000 stars on
GitHub][3], and [over 500 repositories][4] using it. While numbers are just
numbers, they do add to the positive feedback I'm receiving daily. Everything
combined makes me think I'm on the right track which is very motivating to keep
working on Knip.

## So... What's Been Cooking Lately?

- Migration to a monorepo setup
- This very website built with Starlight 🌟
- Extended documentation for just about everything
- Improved JSON reporter for external integrations (e.g. [GitHub Action][5])
- Some breaking changes, but you probably don't need to make any changes

## Breaking Changes

A major bump comes with breaking changes, but most likely no changes necessary
on your end:

- Removed support for Node.js v16, Knip v3 requires at least Node.js v18.6
- Simplified [exit codes][6]
- [Production mode][7] now includes types by default (add `--exclude types` for
  previous behavior)
- Removed `--ignore-internal` flag; [`@internal`][8] exports ignored in
  production mode now
- The `--debug-file-filter` flag is removed
- The `jsonExt` reporter is now the default [JSON reporter][9] (the previous one
  is gone)
- Moved `typescript` to `peerDependencies` (requires `>=5.0.4`)
