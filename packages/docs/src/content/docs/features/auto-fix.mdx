title: Auto-fix
---

import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import { Badge } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Run Knip as you normally would, and if the report looks good then run it again
with the `--fix` flag to let Knip automatically apply fixes. It fixes the
following [issue types][1]:

- Remove `export` keyword for unused exports and exported types
- Remove `export default` keywords for unused default exports
- Remove exports, re-exports and exported types
- Remove unused enum members
- Remove unused class members (disabled by default)
- Remove unused `dependencies` and `devDependencies` from `package.json`
- Remove unused files

:::caution

Use a VCS (version control system) like Git to review and undo changes as
necessary.

:::

## Flags

Add the `--fix` flag to remove unused exports and dependencies:

```sh
knip --fix
```

Add `--allow-remove-files` to allow Knip to remove unused files:

```sh
knip --fix --allow-remove-files
```

Use `--fix-type` to fix only specific issue types:

- `files`
- `exports`
- `types`
- `dependencies`

Example:

```sh
knip --fix-type exports,types
knip --fix-type exports --fix-type types   # same as above
```

  <source src="/screenshots/fix.webm" type="video/webm" />
</video>

## Post-fix

After Knip has fixed issues, there are four things to consider:

### 1. Use a formatter

Use a tool like Prettier or Biome if the code needs formatting. Knip removes the
minimum amount of code while leaving it in a working state.

### 2. Unused variables

Use a tool like ESLint or Biome to find and remove unused variables inside
files. Even better, try [remove-unused-vars][2] to remove unused variables
within files.

This may result in more deleted code, and Knip may then find more unused code.
Rinse and repeat!

### 3. Unused dependencies

Verify changes in `package.json` and update dependencies using your package
manager.

<Tabs syncKey="pm">
  <TabItem label="npm">

    ```shell
    npm install
    ```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="pnpm">

    ```shell
    pnpm install
    ```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="bun">

    ```shell
    bun install
    ```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="yarn">

    ```shell
    yarn
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 4. Install unlisted dependencies

If Knip reports unlisted dependencies or binaries, they should be installed.

<Tabs syncKey="pm">
  <TabItem label="npm">

    ```shell
    npm install unlisted-package
    ```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="pnpm">

    ```shell
    pnpm add unlisted-package
    ```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="bun">

    ```shell
    bun add unlisted-package
    ```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="yarn">

    ```shell
    yarn add unlisted-package
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Example results

### Exports

The `export` keyword for unused exports is removed:

```diff title="module.ts"
-export const unused = 1;
-export default class MyClass {}
+const unused = 1;
+class MyClass {}
```

The `default` keyword was also removed here.

Knip removes the whole or part of export declarations:

```diff title="module.ts"
type Snake = 'python' | 'anaconda';
const Owl = 'Hedwig';
const Hawk = 'Tony';
-export type { Snake };
-export { Owl, Hawk };
+;
+;
```

### Re-exports

Knip removes the whole or part of re-exports:

```diff title="file.js"
-export { Cat, Dog } from './pets';
-export { Lion, Elephant } from './jungle';
+export { Elephant } from './jungle'
```

Also across any chain of re-exports:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="module.ts">

    ```diff
    export const Hawk = 'Tony';
    -export const Owl = 'Hedwig';
    +const Owl = 'Hedwig';
    ```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="barrel.ts">

    ```diff
    export * from './module.js';
    ```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="index.ts">

    ```diff
    -export { Hawk, Owl } from './barrel.js';
    +export { Hawk } from './barrel.js'
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Export assignments

Knip removes individual exported items in "export assignments", but does not
remove the entire export declaration if it's empty:

```diff title="file.js"
-export const { a, b  } = fn();
+export const {   } = fn();

-export const [c, d] = [c, d];
+export const [, ] = [c, d];
```

Reason: the right-hand side of the assignment might have side-effects. It's not
safe to always remove the whole declaration. This could be improved in the
future (feel free to open an issue/RFC).

### Enum members

Unused members of enums are removed:

```diff title="file.ts"
export enum Directions {
  North = 1,
  East = 2,
-  South = 3,
  West = 4,
}
```

### CommonJS

Knip supports CommonJS and removes unused exports:

```diff title="common.js"
-module.exports = { identifier, unused };
+module.exports = { identifier,  };

-module.exports.UNUSED = 1;
-module.exports['ACCESS'] = 1;
+
+
```

Warning: the right-hand side of such an assignment might have side-effects. Knip
currently removes the whole declaration (feel free to open an issue/RFC).

### Dependencies

Unused dependencies are removed from `package.json`:

```diff title="package.json"
 {
   "name": "my-package",
   "dependencies": {
-    "rimraf": "*",
-    "unused-dependency": "*"
+    "rimraf": "*"
   },
-  "devDependencies": {
-    "unreferenced-package": "5.3.3"
-  }
+  "devDependencies": {}
 }
```

### Class members Â  <Badge text="experimental" variant="caution" />

Unused members of classes can be removed:

```diff title="file.ts"
export class Rectangle {
  constructor(public width: number, public height: number) {}

-  static Key = 1;
+

  area() {
    return this.width * this.height;
  }

-  public get unusedGetter(): string {
-    return 'unusedGetter';
-  }
}
```

Currently Knip might be too eager removing class members when they're not
referenced internally but meant to be called by an external library. For
instance, Knip might think `componentDidMount` and `render` in React class
component are unused and will remove those.

Note that [`classMembers` aren't included by default][3].

## What's not included

Operations that auto-fix does not (yet) perform and why:

- Add unlisted (dev) dependencies to `package.json` (should it go into
  `dependencies` or `devDependencies`? For monorepos in current workspace or
  root?)
- Add unlisted binaries (which package and package version contains the used
  binary?)
- Fix duplicate exports (which one should removed?)
