Workspaces are handled out-of-the-box by Knip.

Workspaces are sometimes also referred to as package-based monorepos, or as
packages in a monorepo. Knip uses the term workspace exclusively to indicate a
directory that has a `package.json`.

## Configuration

Here's example configuration with custom `entry` and `project` patterns:

```json title="knip.json"
{
  "workspaces": {
    ".": {
      "entry": "scripts/*.js",
      "project": "scripts/**/*.js"
    },
    "packages/*": {
      "entry": "{index,cli}.ts",
      "project": "**/*.ts"
    },
    "packages/cli": {
      "entry": "bin/cli.js"
    }
  }
}
```

:::tip

Run Knip without any configuration to see if and where custom `entry` and/or
`project` files are necessary per workspace.

:::

Each workspace has the same [default configuration][1].

The root workspace is named `"."` under `workspaces` (like in the example
above).

:::caution

In a project with workspaces, the `entry` and `project` options at the root
level are ignored. Use the workspace named `"."` for those (like in the example
above).

:::

## Workspaces

Knip reads workspaces from four possible locations:

1. The `workspaces` array in `package.json` (npm, Bun, Yarn, Lerna)
2. The `packages` array in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` (pnpm)
3. The `workspaces.packages` array in `package.json` (legacy)
4. The `workspaces` object in Knip configuration

The `workspaces` in Knip configuration (4) not already defined in the root
`package.json` or `pnpm-workspace.yaml` (1, 2, 3) are added to the analysis.

:::caution

A workspace must have a `package.json` file.

:::

For projects with only a root `package.json`, please see [integrated
monorepos][2].

## Additional workspaces

If a workspaces is not configured as such in `package.json#workspaces` (or
`pnpm-workspace.yaml`) it can be added to the Knip configuration manually. Add
their path to the `workspaces` configuration object the same way as
`"packages/cli": {}` in the example above.

## Source mapping

Let's say we have this module in a monorepo that imports `helper` from another
workspace in the same monorepo:

```ts title="index.js"
import { helper } from '@org/shared';
```

The target workspace `@org/shared` has this `package.json`:

```json title="package.json"
{
  "name": "@org/shared",
  "main": "dist/index.js"
}
```

The module resolver will resolve `@org/shared` to `dist/index.js`. That file is
usually compiled and git-ignored, while Knip wants the source file instead. If
the target workspace has a `tsconfig.json` file with an `outDir` option, Knip
will try to map the "dist" file to the "src" file:

```json title="tsconfig.json"
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": "src",
    "outDir": "dist"
  }
}
```

If `src/index.ts` exists, Knip will use that file instead of `dist/index.js`.
Currently this only works based on `tsconfig.json`, in the future more source
mappings may be added.

## Additional options

The following options are available inside workspace configurations:

- [ignore][3]
- [ignoreBinaries][4]
- [ignoreDependencies][5]
- [ignoreMembers][6]
- [includeEntryExports][7]

[Plugins][8] can be configured separately per workspace.

Use `--debug` for verbose output and see the workspaces Knip includes, their
configurations, enabled plugins, glob options and resolved files.

## Lint a single workspace

Use the `--workspace` (or `-W`) argument to focus on a single workspace (and let
Knip run faster). Example:

```sh
knip --workspace packages/my-lib
```

This will include ancestor and dependent workspaces, for two reasons:

- Ancestor workspaces may list dependencies in `package.json` the linted
  workspace uses.
- Dependent workspaces may reference exports from the linted workspace.

To lint the workspace in isolation, you can combine this with [strict production
mode][9].
