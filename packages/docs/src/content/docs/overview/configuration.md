## Defaults

Knip has good defaults and aims for "zero config". For best results, Knip might
need some configuration.

Here's a simplified version of the default configuration:

```json
{
  "entry": ["index.{js,ts}", "src/index.{js,ts}"],
  "project": ["**/*.{js,ts}"]
}
```

Entry files are the starting point for Knip to find more source files and
external dependencies. The resulting set of used files is matched against the
set of `project` files to determine which files are unused.

:::tip

Run Knip without configuration. If it reports false positives, you need a
configuration file. Please also read [configure project files][1].

:::

## Location

By default, Knip will look for a configuration file with the following names:

- `knip.json`
- `knip.jsonc`
- `.knip.json`
- `.knip.jsonc`
- `knip.ts`
- `knip.js`
- `knip.config.ts`
- `knip.config.js`
- `package.json` (in the `"knip"` property)

If you want to use a custom file name or path, use the `--config` flag:

```sh
knip --config path/to/knip.json
```

## Customize

Your project structure may not match the default `entry` and `project` files.
Here's an example custom configuration to include `.js` files in the `scripts`
folder:

```json title="knip.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://unpkg.com/knip@5/schema.json",
  "entry": ["src/index.ts", "scripts/{build,create}.js"],
  "project": ["src/**/*.ts", "scripts/**/*.js"]
}
```

If you override the `entry` file patterns, you may also want to override
`project` file patterns. The set of project files is used to determine what
files are unused. The `project` patterns can also be negated to exclude files
from the analysis. Also see [configuring project files][1].

The values you set override the default values, they are not merged.

:::tip

Be specific with `entry` files. Minimize the number of entry files and wildcards
for better results.

Plugins set entry files for you, such as those for Next.js, Remix, Vitest, and
many more.

Knip looks in many places for entry files. Learn more about this in the next
page about [entry files][2].
