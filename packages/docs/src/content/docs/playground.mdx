Welcome to the Knip playground. The codebases below have linting issues on
purpose in the codebases, so Knip will report various types of issues.

Feel free to play around! There are currently two playgrounds:

- [Basic][1]
- [Monorepo][2]

Shoutout to <a href="https://stackblitz.com">StackBlitz</a> for generously
providing these free dev containers.
