      Knip is a powerful tool that helps thousands of developers keep their
      JavaScript and TypeScript projects lean and maintainable. Knip saves
      teams valuable time and resources.
    </p>

    <p>
      Building and maintaining Knip has been, and remains, a lot of work.
      Supportive resources allow me to focus on maintenance and development of
      Knip, which is <a href="#projects-using-knip">relied upon by many</a> in
      the JavaScript community. Please consider supporting the project! The
      following platforms are available to support Knip:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/sponsors/webpro">GitHub Sponsors</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://opencollective.com/knip">OpenCollective</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      You or your company logo will be added to this page if you decide to
      support the project on an ongoing basis. Eternal gratitude to the
      companies and people supporting the project!

## 游비 Monthly Overview

Overview of gross debit GitHub and OpenCollective sponsorships and invoices,
starting from the moment the project openly asked for support. Actual
development started one year before that.

<SponsorsChart />

- The monthly aggregated average over the charted period is $511.
- The monthly recurring average without one-time payments is $311.
- GitHub Sponsors is for my GitHub account, which has more repositories, but in
  practice targets mostly Knip (and perhaps some [release-it][1]).
