      Knip is a powerful tool that helps thousands of developers keep their
      JavaScript and TypeScript projects lean and maintainable. Knip saves
      teams valuable time and resources.
    </p>

    <p>
      Building and maintaining Knip has been, and remains, a lot of work.
      Supportive resources allow me to focus on maintenance and development of
      Knip, which is <a href="#-projects-using-knip">relied upon</a>
      <a href="https://github.com/webpro-nl/knip/network/dependents">by many</a>
      in the JavaScript community. Please consider supporting the project! The
      following platforms are available to support Knip:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/sponsors/webpro">GitHub Sponsors</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://opencollective.com/knip">OpenCollective</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      You or your company logo will be added to this page if you decide to
      support the project on an ongoing basis. Eternal gratitude to the

## 🧡 Monthly Overview

Overview of gross GitHub and OpenCollective sponsorships and invoices, starting
from the moment the project openly asked for support. Actual development started
one year before that.

<SponsorsChart />

- The monthly aggregated average over the charted period is $511.
- The monthly recurring average without one-time payments is $311.
- GitHub Sponsors is for my GitHub account, which has more repositories, but in
  practice targets mostly Knip (and perhaps some [release-it][1]).
