## Notes

1. When an issue type has zero issues, it is not shown.
2. Including or excluding `dependencies` (via CLI or configuration)
   automatically includes or excludes `devDependencies` and
   `optionalPeerDependencies`. In [rules][3], each key can be set individually.
3. In [strict production mode][4], `devDependencies` are not included.
4. The `types` issue type includes `enum`, `interface` and `type` exports.
