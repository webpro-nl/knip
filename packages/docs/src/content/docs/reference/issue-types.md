## Notes

- When an issue type has zero issues, it is not shown.
- Including or excluding `dependencies` (via CLI or configuration) automatically
  includes or excludes `devDependencies` and `optionalPeerDependencies`. In
  [rules][3], each key can be set individually.
- In [strict production mode][4], `devDependencies` are not included.
- The `types` issue type includes `enum`, `interface` and `type` exports.
