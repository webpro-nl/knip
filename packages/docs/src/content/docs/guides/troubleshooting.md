We can distinguish two types of issues:

- [Lint issues reported by Knip][1]
- [Exceptions thrown by Knip][2]

Also see the [debug][3] and [trace][4] options below that can help to
troubleshoot issues.

:::note

The JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem has a vast amount of frameworks and tools,
and even more ways to configure those. Files and dependencies can be referenced
in many ways, not just through static import statements. In short: "it's
complicated". Knip and documentation are always a work in progress.

If it doesn't come your way at the first try, please understand this also shows
the dynamic and innovative nature of the ecosystem. Often only small changes go
a long way towards success. When a bit of configuration doesn't improve things,
consider [opening an issue][5] and/or [ask away on Discord][6]. With the help of
the community (that's you!) we can improve Knip for everyone and make project
maintenance easier and more fun!

## Lint issues reported by Knip

Knip reports lint issues in your codebase. See [handling issues][7] to deal with
the reported issues.

If Knip reports false positives and you're considering filing a GitHub issue,
please do! It'll make Knip better for everyone. Please read [issue
reproduction][8] first.

Exit code 1 indicates a successful run, but lint issues were found.

## Exceptions thrown by Knip

Knip may throw an exception, resulting in an unsuccessful run.

See [known issues][9] as it may be listed there and a workaround may be
available. If it isn't clear what's throwing the exception, try another run with
`--debug` to locate the cause of the issue with more details.

If Knip throws an exception and you're considering filing a GitHub issue, please
do! It'll make Knip better for everyone. Please read [issue reproduction][8]
first.

Exit code 2 indicates an exception was thrown by Knip.

## Debug

To better understand why Knip reports what it does, run it in debug mode by
adding `--debug` to the command:

```sh
knip --debug
```

This will give a lengthy output, including:

- Included workspaces
- Used configuration per workspace
- Enabled plugins per workspace
- Glob patterns and options followed by matching file paths
- Plugin config file paths and found dependencies per plugin
- Compiled non-standard source files

## Trace

Use `--trace` to see where all exports are used. Or be more specific:

- Use `--trace-file [path]` to output this only for the given file.
- Use `--trace-export [name]` to output this only for the given export name.
- Use both to trace a specific named or default export of a certain file.

This works across re-exports, barrel files and workspaces. Here's an example
screenshot:

<img src="/screenshots/trace.png" alt="trace" class="mw500" />

It's like a reversed module graph. Instead of traversing imports it goes in the
opposite direction and shows where exports are imported.

#### Legend

|     | Description                                 |
| --- | :------------------------------------------ |
| `✓` | Contains import and reference to the export |
| `x` | Is not imported                             |
| `◯` | Entry file                                  |

## Opening an issue

If you want to open an issue, please see [issue reproduction][8].

## Understanding Knip

Looking to better understand how Knip works? The [entry files][10] and
[plugins][11] explanations cover two core concepts. After this you might want to
check out features like [production mode][12] and [monorepos & workspaces][13].

In a more general sense, [Why use Knip?][14] explains what Knip can do for you.

## Asking for help

If you can't find your answer in any of the aforementioned resources, feel free
to [open an issue on GitHub][15] or discuss it in [the Discord channel][6].
