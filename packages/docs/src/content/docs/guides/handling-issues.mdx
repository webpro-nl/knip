A long report can be frustrating. The list may contain false positives, but also
actual clutter. To get the most value out of Knip, it may require some initial
configuration.

This page guides you in dealing with false positives. Especially if you start
out using Knip in a large project and have a long report, it makes sense to go
over the issue types one by one. For instance, reducing the number of unused
files will also reduce the number of unused dependencies.

## Unused files

The first thing we're looking at is unused files, since the positive effect of
getting those right trickles down into the other issue types as well. Files are
reported as unused if they are in the set of `project` files, but not in the set
of files resolved from the `entry` files:

```
unused files = project files - (entry files + resolved files)
```

Let's go over common causes for adding `entry` patterns manually:

- [Dynamic import specifiers][1]
- [Unsupported arguments in scripts][2]
- [Unsupported file formats][3]
- [Missing plugin][4]
- [Incomplete plugin][5]
- [Integrated monorepos][6]
- [Build artifacts and ignored files][7]
- [Auto-mocking or auto-imports][8]

:::caution

Please don't add unused files to the `ignore` option before reading [configuring
project files][9]. Learn why and when to use `entry`, `project` and `ignore`
patterns for better results and performance.

:::

Use `--files` to [filter the report][10] and focus on unused files:

```sh
knip --files
```

This works with other issue types as well. For instance, use `--dependencies` to
focus only on dependencies and exclude issues related to unused files and
exports.

### Dynamic import specifiers

Dynamic import specifiers aren't resolved, such as:

```ts
const entry = await import(path.join(baseDir, 'entry.ts'));
```

Solution: add `entry.ts` to `entry` patterns.

### Unsupported arguments in scripts

Some tooling command arguments aren't recognized:

```json
{
  "name": "my-lib",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "scripts": {
    "build": "unknown-build-cli --entryPath entry.ts"
  }
}
```

The same goes for other scripts such as those in GitHub Actions workflows or Git
hooks. See [script parser][11] for what Knip does support.

Solution: add `entry.ts` to `entry` patterns.

### Unsupported file formats

Entry files referenced in HTML files (e.g. `<script src="entry.js">`).

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <script type="module" src="entry.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Knip has support for some popular framework formats through [compilers][12], and
additional compilers can be added for for any file type.

The recommended solution is usually to add the file as shown in each example as
an `entry` file.

Solution: add `entry.js` to `entry` patterns. Or add an `.html` compiler to
extract and resolve the value of `<script src>` elements.

### Missing plugin

You might be using a tool or framework for which Knip doesn't have a plugin
(yet). Configuration and entry files (and related dependencies) may be reported
as unused because there is no plugin yet that would include those files. For
example,

- Config file `tool.config.js` contains a reference to the package
  `"@tool/plugin"` and both the file and the dependency may be reported as an
  unused.
- A framework imports all files matching `src/models/*.ts` and those might be
  reported as unused.

Solution: [create a new plugin][13] for the tool or framework that's not [in the
list][14] yet. Or work around it and add `entry` patterns and maybe ignore a
dependency or two.

### Incomplete plugin

Files may be reported as unused if existing plugins do not include that entry
file pattern yet. See the [plugins section of entry files][15] for more details.

Solution: [override plugin configuration][16] to customize default patterns for
existing plugins. Or even better: send a pull request to improve the plugin.

### Integrated monorepos

Multiple instances of configuration files like `.eslintrc` and
`jest.config.json` across the repository may be reported as unused when working
in a (mono)repo with a single `package.json`.

Solution: see [integrated monorepos][17] for more details and how to configure
plugins to target those configuration files.

### Build artifacts and ignored files

In rare cases, build artifacts and `.gitignore` files may have a surprising
effects on files reported as unused. Results may be different in separate runs,
depending on the presence of build artifacts. Knip tries to do the right thing,
but in some cases you may need to add a file to the `entry` file patterns
manually for better or more consistent results.

### Auto-mocking or auto-imports

Some frameworks have features like "auto-mocking" or "auto-imports" enabled,
such as Jest and Nuxt.

Solution: include such entry files by extending the `entry` file patterns. This
is recommended in most cases:

```json
{
  "entry": ["src/index.ts", "src/models/*.ts"]
}
```

Alternatively, exceptions and outliers can be excluded from the analysis using
negated `project` patterns:

```json
{
  "project": ["src/**/*.ts", "!src/**/__mocks__/**"]
}
```

## Unused dependencies

First off: dependencies imported in unused files are reported as unused
dependencies. That's why it's strongly recommended to try and remedy [unused
files][18] first. Better `entry` and `project` file coverage will solve many
cases of reported unused dependencies.

The most common causes for unused and unlisted dependencies include:

- [Missing or incomplete plugin][19]
- [Unreachable code][20]

:::caution[Monorepo]

In a monorepo, a dependency is unused in the root workspace's `package.json` if
it's also listed in an descendent workspace, and referenced only in the
descendent workspace.

:::

Use `--dependencies` to [filter the report][10] and focus on dependency related
issues:

```sh
knip --dependencies
```

### Missing or incomplete plugin

If a plugin exists and the dependency is referenced in the configuration file,
but its custom dependency finder does not detect it, then that's a false
positive. Please open a pull request or issue to fix it.

Solution: adding the configuration file as an `entry` file pattern may be a
temporary stopgap that fixes your situation, but it's better to create a new
plugin or fix an existing one.

### Unreachable code

Sometimes a reference to a dependency is unrecognizable or unreachable to Knip.

Solution: add a new plugin or improve an existing one. If you don't feel like a
plugin could solve it, a last resort is to ignore it:

```json
{
  "ignoreDependencies": ["ignore-me", "@problematic/package"]
}
```

If a binary (or "executable") is referenced you'll want to use `ignoreBinaries`
instead. See [unlisted binaries][21].

### Types packages

For packages that have types integrated in the same package, the separate types
package is reported as unused.

This is also useful for future regressions: if a package had a DT package for
its types before and later on integrates those types into its own package, Knip
will start reporting the types dependency as unused. Examples include Webpack v5
and React Router v6 rendering the `@types/webpack` and `@types/react-router`
dependencies obsolete since those versions.

Solution: remove the types dependency (usually `@types` scoped DT package).

### TypeScript, Jest & legacy ESLint

In monorepos, sharing and extending configurations is convenient, but for a
project linter like Knip certain scenarios can be a challenge to assign
dependencies to the right workspace. Specifically, the root cause is usually a
combination of JSON-based configuration files that extend from each other across
workspaces in a monorepo. This is an issue since we can't "assign" dependencies
to other workspaces and incorrectly end up having "unlisted dependencies".

Most notably, tools like TypeScript, Jest and legacy ESLint suffer from this.
The new [ESLint flat config system][22] does not have this issue, so it's
recommended to migrate if you haven't already.

## Unlisted dependencies

This means that a dependency is used, but not listed in `package.json`.

An unlisted dependency is usually a transitive dependency that's imported
directly. The dependency is installed (since it's a dependency of another
dependency) and lives in `node_modules`, but it's not listed explicitly in
`package.json`.

You should not rely on transitive dependencies for various reasons, including
control, security and stability.

Solution: install and list the dependency in `dependencies` or
`devDependencies`.

## Unlisted binaries

Binaries are executable Node.js scripts. Many npm packages, when installed, add
an executable file to use from scripts in `package.json`. Examples include
TypeScript with the `tsc` binary, Next.js with the `next` binary, and so on.

Knip detects such binaries in scripts and checks whether there's a package
installed that includes that binary. It looks up the `bin` field in the
`package.json` file of installed packages. If it doesn't find it, it will be
reported as an unlisted binary as there is no package listed that contains it.

Except for binaries that are most likely meant to be installed on the OS already
and not installed from npm (details: [list in source][23]).

### Missing binaries

In case unused (dev) dependencies look like a match against unlisted binaries,
then this might be caused by `node_modules` not containing the packages. And
this might have been caused by either the way your package manager installs
dependencies and binaries, or by not running Knip from the root of the
repository.

Solution: run Knip from the project root. From there you can [lint individual
workspaces][24].

### Example

Sometimes their usage or the way Knip reports them can be a bit confusing. See
this example:

```json
{
  "name": "lib",
  "scripts": {
    "commitlint": "commitlint --edit"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@commitlint/cli": "*"
  }
}
```

This example works fine without anything reported, as the `@commitlint/cli`
package includes the `commitlint` binary. However, some script may contain
`npx commitlint` and here Knip assumes `commitlint` is the name of the package.
This technically works as `commitlint` is a transitive dependency of
`@commitlint/cli`, but to avoid confusion it's recommended to use
`npx @commitlint/cli`.

## npx

For usages of the `npx` command, Knip assumes `npx --yes my-package` means that
`my-package` is not listed. Knip expects the dependency to be listed with `--no`
or no flag at all. The recommendation here is to be explicit:

- Use `npx --yes` if the dependency is not supposed to be listed in
  `package.json`.
- Use `npx --no` if the dependency is listed in `package.json`.

## Unused exports

By default, Knip does not report unused exports of `entry` files.

The most common causes for unused exports include:

- [Enumerations][25]
- [External libraries][26]

Use the `--exports` flag to [filter][10] and focus on issues related to exports:

```sh
knip --exports
```

### Enumerations

Currently Knip does not consider all exports or enum members referenced when
implicitly referenced in an enumeration like the following example:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="index.js">

    ```ts
    import * as Fruits from './fruits.js';
    import { FruitsEnum } from './fruits.js';

    for (const fruit of Object.values(Fruits)); // Exports are not referenced explicitly

    Object.entries(FruitsEnum); // Members are not referenced explicitly
    ```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="fruits.js">

    ```ts
    export const apple = 'apple';
    export const orange = 'orange';

    export enum FruitsEnum {
      apple = 'apple',
      orange = 'orange',
    }
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

See [namepace imports][27] to see what patterns Knip does consider to be used
exports.

### External libraries

Are the exports consumed or imported by an external library, resulting in a
non-standard consumption of your exports? Here's an example:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="index.js">

    ```ts
    import loadable from '@loadable/component';

    export const DynamicApple = dynamic(() =>
      import('./components.js').then(mod => mod.Apple)
    );

    export const LoadableOrange = loadable(() => import('./components.js'), {
      resolveComponent: components => components.Orange,
    });
    ```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="components.js">

    ```ts
    export const Apple = () => 'Apple';
    export const Orange = () => 'Orange';
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Knip understands `Apple` is used, since it's standard usage. But `Orange` is
referenced through a function of an external library. For performance reasons,
Knip does not include external type definitions by default so it won't see the
export being referenced.

To include the type definitions of external libraries, use the
[--include-libs][28] flag:

```shell
knip --include-libs
```

This comes at a performance and memory penalty, but should give better results
if you need it. This flag is implied when [classMembers][29] are included (that
feature comes with roughly the same performance penalty).

### Exclude exports from the report

To exclude unused exports from the report, there are a few options:

- [Ignore exports used in file][30] for exports used internally.
- Individual exports can be [tagged using JSDoc syntax][31].
- Have the export in an entry file:
  - Add the file to the `entry` file patterns array in the configuration.
  - Move the export(s) to an entry file.
  - Add the file to the `exports` field of `package.json`
- Re-export the unused export(s) from an entry file.

## Missing exports?

Did you expect certain exports in the report, but are they missing? They might
be exported from an entry file. In that case, use [--include-entry-exports][32]
to make Knip also report unused exports in entry files.

The exports of non-standard extensions like `.astro`, `.mdx`, `.vue` or
`.svelte` are not available by default. See [compilers][12] for more details on
how to include them.

## Class members

Unused class members are not reported by default, here's how to enable them:

```sh
knip --include classMembers
```

This option is also available in the Knip configuration file. Note that this
feature comes at a cost: linting will take more time and more memory.

Individual class members can be [tagged using JSDoc syntax][31].

Classes exported from entry files are ignored, and so are their members. Use
[--include-entry-exports][32] to make Knip also report members of unused exports
in entry files.

## Enum members

Unused enums and unused members of enums are reported by default. Reporting such
members can also be disabled altogether, for example:

```sh
knip --exclude enumMembers
```

Individual enum members can be [tagged using JSDoc syntax][31].

Enums exported from entry files are ignored, and so are their members. Use
[--include-entry-exports][32] to make Knip also report members of unused exports
in entry files.

## Feedback or false positives?

If you believe Knip incorrectly reports something as unused (i.e. there's a
false positive), feel free to create a [minimal reproduction][33] and open an
issue on GitHub. It'll make Knip better for everyone! Join the [Discord
channel][34] to discuss any feedback or questions you may have.
