If you encounter an issue or false positives when using Knip, you can [open an
issue on GitHub][1]. This will help you in your project, and will also improve
Knip for everyone else!

Think of Knip like a kitchen sink, it handles a large amount of projects and
configurations, and your project is different from all others. Many factors may
influence the issue at hand, such as:

- Code syntax, import and export structure in source files
- Dependencies, scripts and entry files in `package.json`
- TypeScript configuration in `tsconfig.json`
- Enabled plugins and configuration files for that tooling
- Dependent or depending workspaces in a monorepo
- Knip configuration in `knip.json`

That's why it's required to provide a minimal reproduction: only the source code
and configuration required to reproduce and demonstrate the issue. This makes it
easier to reason about, discuss further and work with. Providing this with an
issue description will help us help you and improve the chances the issue can be
looked into efficiently and in a timely manner.

## Before opening an issue

Before opening an issue, please make sure you:

- are using the latest version
- have read the relevant documentation
- have searched [existing issues][1]
- have checked the list of [known issues][2]

Please file only a single issue at a time, so each of them can be labeled and
tracked separately.

## Templates

A convenient way to create a minimal reproduction is by starting with one of
these templates in CodeSandbox or StackBlitz:

| Template |                  |                 |
| :------- | ---------------- | --------------- |
| Basic    | [CodeSandbox][3] | [StackBlitz][4] |
| Monorepo | [CodeSandbox][5] | [StackBlitz][6] |

Shoutout to [CodeSandbox][7] and [StackBlitz][8] for generously providing these
free dev containers!

## Alternatives

Other solutions to share a minimal and reproducible case may work well too,
including:

- A public repository on e.g. GitHub or GitLab.
- A new [fixtures folder in the Knip repository][9].

The goal is to have an easy and common understanding and reproduction. A link to
your existing project repository will likely not be considered "minimal". Issues
containing just a screenshot, or snippets of output or source code don't provide
the full picture and aren't complete nor actionable.

If you're unable to create a reproduction using one of the methods described
then please clearly explain this in the issue or [contact me][10].

## Pull Request

The optimal way is to add fixtures and failing tests to the Knip repository, and
open a pull request to discuss the issue! Also see [instructions for
development][11].
