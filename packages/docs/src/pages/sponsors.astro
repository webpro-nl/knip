        Knip is a powerful tool that helps thousands of developers keep their
        JavaScript and TypeScript projects lean and maintainable. Knip saves
        teams valuable time and resources.
      </p>

      <p>
        Building and maintaining Knip has been, and remains, a lot of work.
        Supportive resources allow me to focus on maintenance and development of
        Knip, which is <a href="#projects-using-knip">relied upon by many</a> in
        the JavaScript community. Please consider supporting the project! The
        following platforms are available to support Knip:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/sponsors/webpro">GitHub Sponsors</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://opencollective.com/knip">OpenCollective</a></li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        You or your company logo will be added to this page if you decide to
        support the project on an ongoing basis. Eternal gratitude to the

      GitHub Sponsors is for my GitHub account, which has more repositories,
      but in practice targets mostly Knip (and perhaps some
      <a href="https://github.com/release-it/release-it">release-it</a>).
