# ✂️ Knip

Knip finds **unused files, dependencies and exports** in your JavaScript and TypeScript projects. Less code and
dependencies lead to improved performance, less maintenance and easier refactorings.

The documentation is available at [knip.dev][1].

This package is part of [the Knip monorepo][2].
