# Knip Minimal Reproduction

This is a template with only Knip (and TypeScript) pre-installed.

Add files and configuration to this project to create a minimal reproduction of
the issue:

- Add source files
- Add relevant TypeScript configuration to `tsconfig.json`
- Add relevant Knip configuration to `knip.json` (or create `knip.ts`)
- Install and double-check the latest versions of Knip and TypeScript

Use the terminal inside this project to run Knip from the root of the project
with `npx knip`.
