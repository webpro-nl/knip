## Open an issue

Feel free to open an issue for things like this:

- Documentation is incorrect or something is missing.
- Questions about configuration or how to run Knip.
- Discuss whether to start a pull request.

Before you open an issue:

- Make sure you're using the **latest** version of Knip (see
  [https://github.com/webpro-nl/knip/releases][5])
- Use GitHub search to find related questions, known issues, etc.
- If relevant, use the `--debug` flag which might reveal errors, potential
  issues with configuration, etc.

## Open a pull request

Pull requests are welcome!

Please consider this before opening a pull request:

- Open an issue before starting the work if for any reason you're not 100% sure
  about it. We can optimize both your and our time if we discuss ideas and
  choose a direction upfront.
- Pull requests may not align with the general philosophy, or may not be
  affordable to maintain, and therefore rejected.
- Read [development][6] instructions and guidelines.
- If you think your PR is not ready for review yet, [set it as a draft][7].
- No need to worry about commit messages, they will probably be squashed into a
  single commit when merged.
- After your first PR is merged, you are automatically added to the
  [list of contributors](https://knip.dev/#-contributors).
