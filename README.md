# ✂️ Knip

Knip finds **unused files, dependencies and exports** in your JavaScript and TypeScript projects. Less code and
dependencies lead to improved performance, less maintenance and easier refactorings.

```ts
export const myVar = true;
```

This is where ESLint stops: it handles files in isolation, so it does not know whether `myVar` is used somewhere else.
This is where Knip starts: it lints the project as a whole and finds unused exports, files and dependencies.

It's only human to forget to remove things that you no longer use. But how do you find out? Where do you start finding
things that can be removed?

The dots don't connect themselves. This is where Knip comes in:

- [x] Finds **unused files, dependencies and exports**
- [x] Finds used dependencies not listed in `package.json`
- [x] Built-in support for [workspaces (monorepos)][1]
- [x] Growing list of [built-in plugins][2]
- [x] Use [compilers][3] to include other file types (e.g. `.mdx`, `.vue`, `.svelte`)
- [x] Finds binaries and dependencies in npm scripts, and a lot more locations
- [x] Finds unused members of classes and enums
- [x] Finds duplicate exports
- [x] Use [production and strict mode][4] to focus on isolated production code
- [x] Supports any combination of JavaScript and TypeScript
- [x] Multiple built-in [reporters][5] (or use [custom reporters][6] and [preprocessors][7])
- [x] Understands [JSDoc/TSDoc tags][8] (e.g. `@public` and `@internal`)
- [x] Run Knip as part of your CI environment to detect issues and prevent regressions

Knip shines in both small and large projects. It's a fresh take on keeping your projects clean & tidy!

## Getting Started

### Installation

```
npm install -D knip
```

Knip supports LTS versions of Node.js, and currently requires at least Node.js v16.17 or v18.6.

Since v2.33.0, the Bun runtime is also supported.

### Default Configuration

Knip has good defaults and aims for no or little configuration. The (simplified) default config:

```json
{
  "entry": ["index.js", "src/index.js"],
  "project": ["**/*.js"]
}
```

There's more, jump to [Entry Files][20] for details.

Knip looks for this configuration file (ordered by priority):

- `knip.json`
- `knip.jsonc`
- `.knip.json`
- `.knip.jsonc`
- `knip.ts`
- `knip.js`
- `package.json#knip`

You can use a dynamic `knip.ts` with TypeScript if you prefer:

```ts
import type { KnipConfig } from 'knip';

const config: KnipConfig = {
  entry: ['src/index.ts'],
  project: ['src/**/*.ts'],
};

export default config;
```

Use `--config path/to/knip.config.json` for a different path.

### Let's Go!

Run the checks with `npx knip`. Or first add this script to `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "knip": "knip"
  }
}
```

Then use `npm run knip` to analyze the project and output unused files, dependencies and exports.

Knip works just fine with `yarn` or `pnpm` or `bun`.

See [Command Line Options][34] for an overview of available CLI options.

## Configuration

### Entry Files

In addition to `index.js`, the following file names and extensions are also considered entry files:

- `index`, `main` and `cli`
- `js`, `mjs`, `cjs`, `jsx`, `ts`, `mts`, `cts` and `tsx`

This means files like `main.cjs` and `src/cli.ts` are automatically added as entry files. Knip also looks for `entry`
files in other places:

- The `main`, `bin` and `exports` fields of `package.json`.
- [Plugins][2] such as for Jest, Next.js, Svelte or Vitest etc. add entry files.
- The `scripts` in package.json and other scripts may provide entry files.

Knip does this for each [workspace][1] it finds. In a perfectly boring world where everything is according to defaults
you wouldn't even need a `knip.json` file at all.

Larger projects tend to have more things customized, and therefore probably get more out of Knip with a configuration
file. Let's say you are using `.ts` files exclusively and have all source files only in the `src` directory:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://unpkg.com/knip@2/schema.json",
  "entry": ["src/index.ts"],
  "project": ["src/**/*.ts"]
}
```

The `entry` files target the starting point(s) to resolve the rest of the imported code. The `project` files should
contain all files to match against the files resolved from the entry files, including potentially unused files.

### Workspaces

Workspaces are handled out-of-the-box by Knip. Every workspace is part of the analysis.

Workspaces are sometimes also referred to as package-based monorepos, or as packages in a monorepo. Knip uses the term
workspace exclusively to indicate a directory that has a `package.json`.

Here's an example `knip.json` configuration with some custom `entry` and `project` patterns:

```json
{
  "workspaces": {
    ".": {
      "entry": "scripts/*.js",
      "project": "scripts/**/*.js"
    },
    "packages/*": {
      "entry": "{index,cli}.ts",
      "project": "**/*.ts"
    },
    "packages/my-lib": {
      "entry": "main.js"
    }
  }
}
```

It might be useful to run Knip first with no or little configuration to see where it needs custom `entry` and/or
`project` files. Each workspace has the same [default configuration][19].

The root workspace is named `"."` under `workspaces` (like in the example).

Knip supports workspaces as defined in three possible locations:

- In the `workspaces` array in `package.json` (npm, Yarn, Lerna).
- In the `packages` array in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` (pnpm).
- In the `workspaces.packages` array in `package.json` (legacy).
- In the `workspaces` object in Knip configuration.

The `workspaces` in Knip configuration not already defined in the root `package.json` or `pnpm-workspace.yaml` are
added. Knip requires a `package.json` file in each workspace directory.

Here's some example output when running Knip in a workspace:

<img src="./assets/screenshot-workspaces.png" alt="example output in workspaces" width="578">

Use `--debug` to get more verbose output.

Use `--workspace [dir]` to analyze a single workspace (including its ancestors).

The `ignore`, `ignoreBinaries` and `ignoreDependencies` options are available inside workspace configurations.

### Plugins

Plugins tell Knip where to look for configuration and entry files, and if necessary have a custom dependency finder.
Knip plugins are automatically activated, you don't need to install or configure anything.

To explain what they do, here's a quick example `.eslintrc.json` configuration file (for ESLint):

```json
{
  "extends": ["airbnb"],
  "plugins": ["prettier"]
}
```

Knip's ESLint plugin reads `.eslintrc.json` and will return `eslint-config-airbnb` and `eslint-plugin-prettier` from
this example to Knip, so it can tell you whether `package.json` is out of sync. In a nutshell, this is how plugins work.
This is especially useful over time when such configuration files change (and they will)!

Knip contains a growing list of plugins:

- [TypeDoc][plugin-typedoc]
- [TypeScript][plugin-typescript]
- [Vite][plugin-vite]
- [Vitest][plugin-vitest]
- [Webpack][plugin-webpack]

Plugins are automatically activated. Each plugin is automatically enabled based on simple heuristics. Most of them check
whether one of a few dependencies is listed in `package.json`. Once enabled, they add a set of `config` files for
themselves and/or `entry` files for Knip to analyze.

- `config` files are given to the plugin's dependency finder
- `entry` files are given to Knip to include with the analysis of the rest of the source code

See each plugin's documentation for its default values.

#### `config`

Plugins usually include `config` files. They are handled by the plugin's custom dependency finder, which returns all
dependencies referenced in the files it is given. Knip handles the rest to determine which of those dependencies are
unused or missing.

#### `entry`

Other configuration files use `require` or `import` statements to use dependencies, so they don't need special handing
and can be analyzed like any other source file. That's why these configuration files are also used as `entry` files.

#### Plugin configuration

Is a plugin not behaving as expected? There are a few options to modify its behavior:

- Disable a plugin by setting its value to `false` (.e.g `"webpack": false`)
- Force-enable a plugin by setting its value to `true`
- Override a plugin's `config` or `entry` location, for example:

```json
{
  "mocha": {
    "config": "config/mocha.config.js",
    "entry": ["**/*.spec.js"]
  }
}
```

It's rarely necessary to override the `entry` patterns, since plugins also read custom test file patterns from the
tooling configuration (e.g. from the `include` option for Vitest or `testMatch` for Playwright).

Plugin configuration can be set on root and workspace level. If enabled on root level, it can be disabled on workspace
level by setting it to `false` there, and vice versa.

#### Multi-project repositories

Some repositories have a single `package.json`, but consist of multiple projects with configuration files across the
repository (such as the [Nx "intregrated repo" style][46]). Let's assume some of these projects are apps and have their
own Cypress configuration and test files. In that case, we could configure the Cypress plugin like this:

```json
{
  "cypress": {
    "entry": ["apps/**/cypress.config.ts", "apps/**/cypress/e2e/*.spec.ts"]
  }
}
```

#### Create a new plugin

Getting false positives because a plugin is missing? Want to help out? Please read more at [writing a plugin][47]. This
guide also contains more details if you want to learn more about plugins and why they are useful.

### Compilers

Compilers allow to include files that are not JavaScript or TypeScript in the process of finding unused or missing
dependencies (e.g. `.mdx`, `.vue` and `.svelte` files).

This requires using a dynamic `knip.js` or `knip.ts` configuration file. Provide a `compilers` object in the
configuration where each key represents the extension and the value is a function that takes the contents of these files
as input and returns JavaScript or TypeScript as output. Here is an example that compiles `.mdx` files to JavaScript so
these files and their imports and exports become part of the analysis:

```js
import { compileSync } from 'mdx-js/mdx';

export default {
  compilers: {
    mdx: compileSync,
  },
};
```

Read [Compilers][48] for more details and examples.

### Ignore files, binaries, dependencies and workspaces

There are a few ways to tell Knip to ignore certain files, binaries, dependencies and workspaces. Some examples:

```json
{
  "ignore": ["**/*.d.ts", "**/fixtures"],
  "ignoreBinaries": ["zip", "docker-compose"],
  "ignoreDependencies": ["hidden-package"],
  "ignoreWorkspaces": ["packages/ignore", "packages/examples/**"]
}
```

These can also be configured per workspace (except for `ignoreWorkspaces`).

### Public exports

Sometimes a file that's not an entry file has one or more exports that are public and should not be reported as unused.
Such variables and types can be marked with the JSDoc `@public` tag:

```js
/**
 * Merge two objects.
 *
 * @public
 */

export const merge = function () {};

/** @public */
export const split = function () {};
```

Knip does not report public exports and types as unused.

### Ignore exports used in file

In files with multiple exports, some of them might be used only internally. If these exports should not be reported,
there is a `ignoreExportsUsedInFile` option available. With this option enabled, you don't need to mark everything
`@public` separately and when something is no longer used internally, it will still be reported.

```json
{
  "ignoreExportsUsedInFile": true
}
```

In a more fine-grained manner, you can also ignore only specific issue types:

```json
{
  "ignoreExportsUsedInFile": {
    "interface": true,
    "type": true
  }
}
```

### Include exports in entry files

When a repository is self-contained or private, you may want to include entry files when reporting unused exports:

```
knip --include-entry-exports
```

Knip will also report unused exports in entry source files and scripts (such as those referenced in `package.json`). But
not in entry and configuration files from plugins, such as `next.config.js` or `src/routes/+page.svelte`.

### Paths

Tools like TypeScript, Webpack and Babel support import aliases in various ways. Knip automatically includes
`compilerOptions.paths` from the TypeScript configuration, but does not (yet) automatically find other types of import
aliases. They can be configured manually:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://unpkg.com/knip@2/schema.json",
  "paths": {
    "@lib": ["./lib/index.ts"],
    "@lib/*": ["./lib/*"]
  }
}
```

Each workspace can also have its own `paths` configured. Knip `paths` follow the TypeScript semantics:

- Path values are an array of relative paths.
- Paths without an `*` are exact matches.

## Production Mode

The default mode for Knip is holistic and targets all project code, including configuration files and tests. Test files
usually import production files. This prevents the production files or their exports from being reported as unused,
while sometimes both of them can be removed. This is why Knip has a "production mode".

To tell Knip what is production code, add an exclamation mark behind each `pattern!` that is meant for production and
use the `--production` flag. Here's an example:

```json
{
  "entry": ["src/index.ts!", "build/script.js"],
  "project": ["src/**/*.ts!", "build/*.js"]
}
```

Here's what's included in production mode analysis:

- Only `entry` and `project` patterns suffixed with `!`.
- Only production `entry` file patterns exported by plugins (such as Next.js and Gatsby).
- Only the `start` and `postinstall` scripts (e.g. not the `test` or other npm scripts in `package.json`).
- Only unused `exports`, `nsExports` and `classMembers` are reported (not `types`, `nsTypes`, `enumMembers`).

### Strict

Additionally, the `--strict` flag can be used to:

- Consider `dependencies` (not `devDependencies`) when finding unused or unlisted dependencies.
- Include `peerDependencies` when finding unused or unlisted dependencies.
- Ignore type-only imports (`import type {}`).
- Verify each workspace is self-contained: have their own `dependencies` (and not use packages of ancestor workspaces).

### Ignore `@internal` exports

In addition to the flags above, the `--ignore-internal` flag can be used to ignore exports tagged with `@internal`. This
can be useful in production mode, since `@internal` exports might be only imported from non-production code.

### Plugins

Plugins also have this distinction. For instance, Next.js entry files for pages (`pages/**/*.tsx`) and Remix routes
(`app/routes/**/*.tsx`) represent production code, while Jest and Storybook entry files (e.g. `*.spec.ts` or
`*.stories.js`) do not. All of this is handled automatically by Knip and its plugins.

### Reading the report

The report contains the following types of issues:

| Title                               | Description                                     | Key            |
| :---------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------- | :------------- |
| Unused files                        | unable to find references to this file          | `files`        |
| Unused dependencies                 | unable to find references to this dependency    | `dependencies` |
| Unused devDependencies              | unable to find references to this devDependency | `dependencies` |
| Unlisted dependencies               | used dependencies not listed in package.json    | `unlisted`     |
| Unlisted binaries                   | binaries from deps not listed in package.json   | `binaries`     |
| Unresolved imports                  | unable to resolve this (import) specifier       | `unresolved`   |
| Unused exports                      | unable to find references to this export        | `exports`      |
| Unused exports in namespaces        | unable to find direct references to this export | `nsExports`    |
| Unused exported types               | unable to find references to this exported type | `types`        |
| Unused exported types in namespaces | unable to find direct references to this export | `nsTypes`      |
| Unused exported enum members        | unable to find references to this enum member   | `enumMembers`  |
| Unused exported class members       | unable to find references to this class member  | `classMembers` |
| Duplicate exports                   | the same thing is exported more than once       | `duplicates`   |

Note that `devDependencies` is covered within a single key for all `dependencies`. In [strict production mode][4],
`devDependencies` are not included.

When an issue type has zero issues, it is not shown.

Getting too many reported issues and false positives? Read more about [handling issues][49].

### Rules & Filters

Use rules or filters if you don't (yet) want all issue types Knip reports.

#### Rules

Use `rules` in the configuration to customize the issue types that count towards the total error count, or to exclude
them altogether.

- `error` (default): printed, adds to total error count (similar to the `--include` filter)
- `warn`: printed in faded/grey color, does not add to error count (i.e. the exit code)
- `off`: not printed, does not add to error count (similar to the `--exclude` filter)

Example:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "files": "warn",
    "classMembers": "off",
    "duplicates": "off"
  }
}
```

See [reading the report][31] for the list of issue types.

The rules are modeled after the ESLint `rules` configuration, and could be extended in the future. For instance, to
apply filters or configurations only to a specific issue type.

#### Filters

You can `--include` or `--exclude` any of the reported issue types to slice & dice the report to your needs.
Alternatively, they can be added to the configuration (e.g. `"exclude": ["dependencies"]`).

Use `--include` to report only specific issue types (the following example commands do the same):

```
knip --include files --include dependencies
knip --include files,dependencies
```

Use `--exclude` to ignore reports you're not interested in:

```
knip --include files --exclude classMembers,enumMembers
```

Use `--dependencies` or `--exports` as shortcuts to combine groups of related types.

See [reading the report][31] for the list of issue types.

#### When to use rules or filters

Filters are meant to be used as command-line flags, rules allow for more fine-grained configuration.

- Rules are more fine-grained since they also have "warn".
- Rules could be extended in the future.
- Filters can be set in configuration and from CLI, rules only in configuration.
- Filters have two groups (`--dependencies` and `--exports`), rules don't have any grouping.

### Reporters

Knip provides the following built-in reporters:

- codeowners
- compact
- json
- symbol (default)

#### Custom Reporters

When the provided built-in reporters are not sufficient, a custom reporter can be implemented.

Find more details in [reporters and preprocessors][50].

#### Preprocessers

Use preprocessers to modify the results before they're passed to the reporter(s).

Find more details in [reporters and preprocessors][50].

## Fixing Issues

This is the fun part! Knip, knip, knip ✂️

Tip: back up files or use an VCS like Git before deleting files or making changes. Run tests to verify results.

- Unused files can be removed.
- Unused dependencies can be removed from `package.json`.
- Unlisted dependencies should be added to `package.json`.
- Unresolved imports should be reviewed.
- Unused exports and types: remove the `export` keyword in front of unused exports. Then you can see whether the
  variable or type is used within the same file. If this is not the case, it can be removed.
- Duplicate exports can be removed so they're exported only once.

Repeat the process to reveal new unused files and exports. It's so liberating to remove unused things!

Getting too many reported issues and false positives? Read more about [handling issues][49] describing potential causes
for false positives, and how to handle them.

## JSDoc tags

Knip takes the following JSDoc/TSDoc tags into account:

| Tag         | Description                                             |
| :---------- | :------------------------------------------------------ |
| `@public`   | Do not report this unused export, type or member        |
| `@beta`     | ^^ Idem                                                 |
| `@internal` | Do not report this unused export in `--production` mode |
| `@alias`    | Do not report this duplicate export                     |

Below some similar commands to get another idea of what Knip does in comparison:

### depcheck

The following commands are similar:

```
depcheck
knip --dependencies
```

### unimported

The following commands are similar:

```
unimported
knip --production --dependencies --include files
```

Also see [production mode][4].

### ts-unused-exports

The following commands are similar:

```
ts-unused-exports
knip --include exports,types,nsExports,nsTypes
knip --exports  # Adds unused enum and class members
```

### ts-prune

The following commands are similar:

```
ts-prune
knip --include exports,types
knip --exports  # Adds unused exports/types in namespaces and unused enum/class members
```

## Why "Knip"?

Knip is Dutch for a "cut". A Dutch expression is "ergens ge**knip**t voor zijn", which means to be perfectly suited for
the job. I'm motivated to make Knip perfectly suited for the job of cutting projects to perfection! ✂️

## Really, another unused file/dependency/export finder?

As listed above, there are already some great packages available if you want to find unused dependencies OR unused
exports. I love the Unix philosophy ("do one thing well"). But looking at what Knip does, I believe it's efficient to
handle multiple concerns in a single tool. When building a dependency graph of the project, an abstract syntax tree for
each file, and traversing all of this, why not collect the various issues in one go?
